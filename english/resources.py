YouTube -> Summary -> Blog Outline Using SimplerLLM

Below is an example of a 3-step automation workflow that helps you repurpose any YouTube video into a 
structured Blog outline using SimplerLLM.

Here's a visual demonstration to simplify the idea more for you:

[A visual demonstration of the steps to do]

The code I'm about to show you will first take a YouTube video URL, extract the transcript, turn it into 
a bullet point summary using OpenAI's API, and then turn this summary into a well-structured blog post outline:

[An image of the whole code]

As you can see, we're using two prompts in this script: one that turns the video transcript into a bullet 
point summary and another that turns the summary into an outline. Although these prompts use the basic components 
of a good prompt, however, they can be improved. (Read this article)[link to my article] to learn how you can craft your own prompts 
the right way!

In addition to the code above, you're gonna need to create a ".env" file in the same folder as the code, 
which contains your OpenAI API key and Gemini API key. (you can leave the Gemini key blank if you plan only 
on using OpenAI and vice versa) Like this:

[An image of the .env file]

Now, you have your own AI automation engine that turns any YouTube video into a blog post outline, 
which will help you write your own blog posts much faster and more easily.
