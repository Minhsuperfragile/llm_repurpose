\section{Script Generated by Llama3.3 Q8}
The script generated by Llama3.3 Quantized 8-bit showcased high-quality content with notable coherence and creativity. The model effectively structured the podcast script, maintaining a logical flow of ideas and engaging language. Here is a sample excerpt:

\begin{quote}
"Welcome to todayâ€™s episode! We're diving into the fascinating world of local language models and how they revolutionize podcast creation."
\end{quote}

The Llama3.3 Q8's use of advanced quantization techniques allowed for efficient performance on limited hardware without sacrificing the richness of the output.

\section{Script Generated by Llama3.3 Q4}
The script generated by Llama3.3 Q4 demonstrated a balance between efficiency and performance. While the output was slightly less detailed compared to the Q8 model, it still managed to deliver a coherent and engaging script. An excerpt:

\begin{quote}
"In this episode, we explore how local language models bring creativity to your fingertips, making podcast scripting faster and smarter."
\end{quote}

The Q4 quantization provided a lighter model footprint, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments while still producing quality results.
